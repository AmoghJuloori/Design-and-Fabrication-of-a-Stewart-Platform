# Design-and-Fabrication-of-a-Stewart-Platform
This project is focuses on the design and fabrication of a Stewart platform and uses an Arduino UNO to write down codes for generating the required actuation on the servos, which are connected to the metal rods through the bearing joints and move and align the platform as desired.
Please refer to [Stewart_Platform_Report.pdf](https://github.com/AmoghJuloori/Design-and-Fabrication-of-a-Stewart-Platform/blob/main/Stewart_Platform_Report.pdf) for a detailed report of the components, code used in the project.
