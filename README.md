# Design-and-Fabrication-of-a-Stewart-Platform
This project is focuses on the design and fabrication of a Stewart platform and uses an Arduino UNO to write down codes for generating the required actuation on the servos, which are connected to metal rods through spherical rod end bearings and move and align the platform as desired.
